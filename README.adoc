= TriplotRecipes.jl

This package provides recipes for https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl[Plots.jl] for plotting contour lines and pseudocolor plots on unstructured triangular meshes (`tricontour` and `tripcolor`).
The mesh itself can be shown with `trimesh`.
The contour line computation and pseudocolor rasterization is performed with https://github.com/pazner/TriplotBase.jl[TriplotBase.jl].

Filled contour plots are not currently supported (cf. https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/972[this issue] in Plots.jl).

== Usage

The main functionality of TriplotRecipes.jl is provided in the following functions:

* `tricontour`
* `tripcolor` (and the closely related `dgtripcolor`)
* `trimesh`

The functions `tricontour` and `tripcolor` take arrays of vertex coordinates (`x` and `y`), vertex funciton values (`z`), and a triangulation (`t`).
`tricontour` also takes a `levels` argument, which is either an integer (number of contour lines) or a list of contour values.
The variant `dgtripcolor` is intended for drawing pseudocolor plots of discontinuous fields.
In this case, the `z` array has shape `(3, nt)`, where `nt` is the number of triangles.

The function `trimesh` takes vertex coordinates (`x` and `y`) and a triangulation (`t`) and draws the mesh.
The line color and fill color (potentially transparent) can be specified.

All of these functions accept keyword arguments for http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/attributes/[Plots.jl attributes].
