= TriplotRecipes.jl

This package provides recipes for Plots.jl for plotting contour lines and pseudocolor plots on unstructured triangular meshes (`tricontour` and `tripcolor`).
The mesh itself can be shown with `trimesh`.
The contour line computation and pseudocolor rasterization is performed with https://github.com/pazner/TriplotBase.jl[TriplotBase.jl].

Filled contour plots are not currently supported.
